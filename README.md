# README

Source for the bot running at [Effin Bot](https://www.effinbot.com) - a Slack Bot for [Effin Birds quotes](https://twitter.com/EffinBirds) that I created because I liked the idea and was looking to create a Slack Bot.

This is done using Rails and OAuth. It contains a barebone working OAuth & CommandsControlle which may be used for other Rails based bots.

God willing, I'll make a blog post documenting the experience in the coming days - until then do whatever you want with it.
